You may use multiple conditionals in if ... elif ... structures.

You will have to take into account that Reviewers' items do not have a "reads" key. Their average amount should be 0.

You will also have to take into account Authors with an empty list of items.

And also make sure the function does not return an error if we type the name of an author that does not exist.

Remember to base the calculation only on the articles with the status set to Published.
